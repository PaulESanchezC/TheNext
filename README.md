# TheNext

The data analysis department requires to do their SSIS, but the company updated their system to the latests Visual studio (VS2022), after months on waiting for SSIS support so they can do their jobs, they have decided to contact me to help develop some mock up of a SSIS tool to help them achieve some data collection for a data warehouse, from other departments.

# The Problem (Lore)
The management department wants to expand the company's market coverage and needs to have metrics to make the smart bussiness decision.

The data analysis department have some great developers in their team, but they use a low class language (python), 
being under the gun, they get to work in any way they can, collecting information in any format they can and trying to make sense of it.

They are outweighed by data, they require a hero developer to save them.

this is where i come in...
