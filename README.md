# TheNext

The data analysis department requires to do their SSIS, but the company updated their system to the latests Visual studio (VS2022), after months on waiting for SSIS support so they can do their jobs, they have decided to contact me to help develop some mock up of a SSIS tool to help them achieve some data collection for a data warehouse, from some other departments.

# The Problem
The management department wants to expand the company's market coverage and needs to have metrics to make the smart bussiness decision.

The data analysis department have some great developers in their team, but they use a low class language (python), 
and being under the gun require a hero developer to save them.

this is where i come in...
